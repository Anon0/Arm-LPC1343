This code is also meant for use with LCPXpresso Compiler Suite Which May be obtained
for free from Code Red. http://ics.nxp.com/lpcxpresso/#GetLPCXpresso
However you must fill out a registration form and register LPCXpresso. Development is
recomended with windows as Linux atm is having troubles interfacing with the devices
secondary boot loader ( Will not flush the write buffer after copying the firmware.bin )
+ has issues unmounting. I have also included a precompiled binary cause they are tiny ...
less than 32kb! Overhead from CMSIS is ~1-2kb
